# Sales_Predictor

# Overview
This project predicts sales figures based on input features like marketing spend, seasonality, and other relevant parameters. It uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for predictions and integrates the functionality into a Django web application. This tool is designed to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

# Features

. Predicts future sales based on input parameters.

. Utilizes SVM for regression analysis.

. Easy-to-use Django web interface for data input and prediction.

. Provides interactive visualizations of sales trends.


Dataset

Source: Link to Dataset (e.g., Kaggle, UCI, or custom data).

Description: The dataset includes features such as:

. Marketing Spend (e.g., TV, Radio, Digital)

. Region

. Seasonality (e.g., festive season indicators)

. Historical Sales

# Technologies Used
